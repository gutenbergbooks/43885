<h2>Preface</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the farther side of the great Pacific
Ocean are the Philippine Islands. These form
one of the many island groups that hang like a
fringe or festoon on the skirt of the continent
of Asia. Like most of the islands in the Pacific,
the Philippines are inhabited by people belonging
to the brown race, one of the great divisions
of the family of mankind.</p>

<p>The Philippines are shared by many tribes,
all belonging to the same brown race. People
of one tribe may be found on one of these
islands; those of a different tribe are living
on another; or one tribe may live in a valley
and its neighbour in the hills; and so on
to the number of eighty tribes. Each tribe
has its own customs and ways. And yet we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
shall call these various peoples of the brown
race our cousins; for not only are they our
kindred by the ties which unite all the races
of men in this world; they have been adopted
into the family of our own nation, the United
States of America.</p>

<p>The people of these islands are many of
them wild and distrustful children. They
have no faith in us; they do not wish to obey
our laws. If we are in earnest in our wish to
do them good, and not harm, we must learn
to know them better, so that we may understand
their needs. That is one reason why
we are going to learn about our little Philippine
cousin, Alila of Luzon.</p>

<div class='adtitle2'>ALILA<br />

Our Little Philippine Cousin</div>



<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<small>THE NEW BABY.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Alila</span> is such a strong, active boy now, it is
hard to imagine him in his babyhood,&mdash;he
was such a tiny brown tot!</p>

<p>His nose was so flat one would hardly have
noticed there was a nose at all, except for the
wideness of the nostrils. His big black eyes
seemed to be moving around all the time, as
much as to say:</p>

<p>"I must find out everything I can, and just
as fast as I can, about this queer place in which
I find myself."</p>

<p>His hair was straight and coarse and black,
even on the day he was born. It was quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
warm (in fact, almost all the days are warm in
the Philippines), yet the doorway was carefully
covered and the windows closed tightly.</p>

<p>Now, why do you suppose Alila found himself
shut up in a close room like that when
he first entered this big round world of ours,
while there was such a soft gentle breeze outside
as scarcely to move the tops of the cacao-trees
in the garden?</p>

<p>The fact is, Alila's father, who is not afraid
of the wild buffalo nor the boa-constrictor, nor
even the huge cayman, is constantly dreading
the evil that bad spirits may bring to him.
And now he had a darling boy of his very own!
According to the beliefs of his people, no evil
spirit must be allowed to enter a home when a
child is born, or the little one might be troubled
by the spirit for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>So the loving parent walked back and forth
over the roof waving a bolo in his hand, as
much as to say:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look out, spirits, or you may get your
throats cut. Keep away from here. Do not
try to get inside to trouble my little one."</p>

<p>He did this very earnestly in the first hour
of Alila's life, although he was shown the
foolishness of such ideas by the priests the
Spaniards sent among his people.</p>

<p>He is a small man, this father of Alila. He
has high cheek-bones like the Chinese and
Japanese, and no beard upon his face.</p>

<p>When he felt that everything was really
safe, he climbed down from the thatched roof,
and, opening the door as little as possible,
went softly up to the mat where the baby
lay and kissed him.</p>

<p>But, dear me! not all persons kiss the
way we do, and this father of the Malay
race seemed rather to <em>smell</em> the baby than
anything else we can think of. He placed
his own nose and lips on the baby's cheek
and drew a long breath. It was done to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
show his love, and that is what any kiss is
given for, is it not?</p>

<p>This baby's bed would not, perhaps, suit all
the other babies in the world. Some of those
babies we know are cared for on cushions of
down and wrapped in soft flannels and delicate
muslins. But what did black-eyed Alila care
for that? To be sure, he lay on a mat of
woven palm leaves, but it was sweet and fresh.</p>

<p>And although the floor his eyes sometimes
rested on was not covered with a rich velvet
carpet, it was smooth and clean, for it was
made of split bamboos flattened and fitted close
together. And oh, that floor was beautifully
polished by Mother Nature herself, for the
bamboos as they grow are covered on the outside
with a coating of the finest and hardest
varnish.</p>

<p>If Alila could have thought about it at all,
he would have considered himself more fortunate
than most babies,&mdash;for did not his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
dear mother, who lay at his side, make every
bit of the spread which covered his tiny body?
She had taken the fibres of pineapple leaves
and hemp and woven them together.</p>

<p>But that alone would not make the spread
beautiful enough for her dear one. It must be
given a bright colour, so she searched through
the woods till she found a sapan-wood tree;
then, breaking off some branches and opening
them, she took a substance from the heart of
each and made a crimson dye.</p>

<p>So you can see that the cover was done entirely
by Alila's mother; and you can ask
yourself if that wasn't a hundred times better
than buying cloth out of a store. That
would not have the touch of love in its
making.</p>

<p>There was something else in Alila's home
one does not see in other lands. Whenever
the baby's eyes turned toward the light, they
found it very soft and restful, for it came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
through a window in which were fitted the
inner shells of a certain kind of oyster.</p>

<p>It was so pretty! The colours of the rainbow
shone there in pale tints, and the flaring
sunshine could not enter. The room was
kept in a sort of twilight all day long, and
made it pleasant for the new-born baby and
his mamma to doze and dream.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<small>HIS FIRST PARTY.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Alila</span> was not two hours old before friends
began to arrive to see him. But they did not
enter suddenly! That would have been the
height of rudeness. As they reached the
doorway, each in turn stood for a long time
on the outside, making many complimentary
remarks to Alila's family. That was their way
of showing themselves well-mannered and
polite.</p>

<p>The Tagals, for that is the name of this
tribe of people, never do anything suddenly.
They do not appear to believe in surprise
parties.</p>

<p>When all the fine speeches which seemed
proper had been made, they entered the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
house and came to the side of the new baby.
They made the young mother very proud by
the praise they gave her tiny son.</p>

<p>But she and her husband were not the only
ones pleased. There was Alila's grandmother,
who was always the most honoured one in the
household; there was also an aunt who made
her home here as she was too poor to have one
of her own; and beside these, there was a lame
old man, a friend of the family, who had come
to them for shelter. The Tagals are so hospitable
they will never turn any one from their
homes.</p>

<p>As one visitor after another arrived, the
little house became crowded. If it had not been
for the high, dome-shaped roof, the air would
have grown heavy and impure. As it was,
Alila and his mother soon grew very tired and
closed their eyes in sleep.</p>

<p>"That is good," said the grandmother, "we
must let her rest. We will go out under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
cacao-trees and talk, and I will bring some
cocoa wine and betel to you there."</p>

<p>This old woman was certainly not pretty,
although good and thoughtful. As she stood
talking to the visitors in low tones, one could
see how short she was. Her coarse, black hair
grew down upon her forehead almost to her
eyebrows; her wrinkled skin was dark brown;
her eyes were large and round and, like her
baby grandchild's, ever turning in a new
direction.</p>

<p>She was dressed in a short skirt much like
those of the other women of the party; it was
of three colours,&mdash;green, white, and bright red.
Over this she wore a large piece of blue cotton
cloth, cut in the shape of an oblong, tucked in
at the waist and hanging over her skirt almost
down to her knees. No shoes or stockings
covered the bare legs or feet, but she did not
seem to miss them.</p>

<p>She was as straight as an arrow, even if she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
were a grandmother. Perhaps it was because
she had been used to carrying jars of water and
baskets of fruit upon her head ever since she
was a little child.</p>

<p>She moved softly about the hut as she
got the entertainment ready for the company.
From one corner she drew forth a large bamboo
with a grass stopple in it. This held the
wine the guests would sip so sparingly, for the
Tagals are a sober people and seldom drink
enough fermented liquor to hurt them. The
old woman next got some cocoanut shells together.
These were the only drinking-cups
the family ever used.</p>

<p>But the betel which she now placed beside
the other things,&mdash;what is that, you ask? It
is not a food, and yet it often takes the place
of food; for a Tagal can work a long time
without eating if he can chew all of this he
wishes. It is prepared from the nut of the
areca palm, one of the most beautiful trees in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the world. A palm of this kind grows right
beside Alila's home, and, now that he is a big
boy, he climbs the tall tree himself and brings
down the nuts which grow at the top under
the tuft of glossy green leaves.</p>

<p>The nuts are cut into thin slices and wrapped
in the leaves of a singular plant called buyo.
But, before they can be used for this purpose,
these leaves are coated with lime made from
oyster shells and then folded up.</p>

<p>Alila's grandmother prepared a quantity of
betel before the new baby was born.</p>

<p>Just as she was going out to offer refreshments,
another visitor arrived. It was a friend
who had come from a distance, but the mother
and child must not be wakened. Oh, no!
that was not to be thought of. The souls of
people leave their bodies and go away while
they are sleeping, the old woman believes;
and if any one should arouse them suddenly,
they might never return to their bodies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>So, of course, the visitor, who also had this
belief, wouldn't have disturbed the sleepers for
anything in the world. She quietly turned
away and joined the other guests in the garden.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<small>THE CHRISTENING.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Alila</span> was christened soon after he was
born. Dear me, what a time that was! The
festival lasted several days. There was a host
of friends and acquaintances around the little
home, making merry and admiring the baby.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 342px;">
<img src="images/i023.jpg" width="342" height="500" alt="Mother holding baby up in the air" />
<div class="caption">"HIS MOTHER HAD BATHED HIM IN THE WATER OF THE
RIVER"</div>
</div>
<p>Alila himself was as clean and sweet as any
child in the world could be. His mother had
bathed him in the water of the river which
flowed down the mountainside near them,
while the leaves of the papaw-tree took the
place of soap.</p>

<p>The young mother herself was only fifteen
years old. She was dressed in her brightest
skirt and fairly shone with the abundance of
cheap jewelry she wore. Her hair was combed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
straight back from her forehead. She wore
nothing on her feet excepting her queer slippers,
of which she seemed very proud. She
had herself embroidered them to look like a
pair worn by the rich lady whose husband
owned the plantation. They were perfectly
flat and had only uppers enough to encase two
or three toes.</p>

<p>What queer, uncomfortable things to wear
on one's feet! Alila will never own such
things because he is a boy, and he should be
glad of it.</p>

<p>His grandmother and aunt had a fine feast
prepared for the visitors. There was a good
supply of roasted buffalo and wild boar's meat.
There was a salad made from the young green
tops of the bamboo; steamed rice and stewed
iguana; papaws, which tasted like melons;
tamarind sauce and guavas and bananas. And,
of course, there was an abundance of betel,
cocoa wine and tuba.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>But strangest of all the dishes at the Tagal's
feast was one prepared from a kind of beetle.
The guests relished it greatly and Alila's
father was praised very much for surprising
them with this dainty.</p>

<p>But the feast was only a small part of the
entertainment. A band came from the village
to furnish music. Every instrument on which
they played was made of bamboo. Then
there was dancing and singing under the palm-trees
by old and young, and when evening
came there were displays of fireworks.</p>

<p>As Alila's father was quite poor, how could
he afford such splendour? The fact is, it cost
him nothing! It was a free show given by
Mother Nature. Her little children, the fireflies,
gathered in great numbers and danced in
circles around the trees. Any one ought to be
satisfied with fireworks like those.</p>

<p>Alila's eyes watched the people eat with
their fingers and looked at the lights dancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
about; he listened to the odd, sweet music for
a little while; and then those black eyes closed
tightly and he lay fast asleep in his young
mother's arms. Of course, he doesn't remember
anything about it now, but his grandmother
has told him the story so many times
it almost seems as though his own mind had
kept the pictures for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<small>THE BUILDING OF THE HOUSE.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">And</span> now he is a big boy, ten years old, and
can do so many things to help his parents. He
has not always lived in the home where he
was born. Last summer a whirlwind destroyed
that one, but he helped his father build another
just like the first, and he showed himself
a very clever worker.</p>

<p>He searched through the forest for bamboos
of the right size; he did his share in cutting
them down and splitting them for the walls of
the hut. When they were ready, he worked
each morning in thatching the roof until it
grew too warm. Then came dinner and a nap
under the trees until the late afternoon, when
work began again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>In a few days a new home was ready and
the terrible hurricane forgotten by the carefree,
happy little boy.</p>

<p>Can you guess what part of the hut took
the largest share of Alila's time and attention?
It must have been the window-panes, for he
was anxious to get the most beautiful mother-of-pearl
he could find. He had to take a trip
to the seashore ten miles away, and then he
spent many hours finding such oyster shells as
had a very delicate lining.</p>

<p>"The two windows must be beauties," said
the boy to himself, "for that will please my
mother so much."</p>

<p>No carpenter's shop nor store was visited
during the whole time. It was not needful,
for the forest near by stretched its arms toward
the workers, as much as to say: "Come
to me; I will gladly give you everything you
can possibly wish."</p>

<p>"How about nails," you ask, "and stout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
cord with which to fasten all the parts together?"</p>

<p>Nails, and a bolt in the door? Why, what
could be better than a stick of rattan, cut and
whittled into shape? Cord? That was obtained
very easily, too, from a bushrope-tree
growing near Alila's home. It is so stout and
strong it is not an easy thing to break it.</p>

<p>When the house was finished, it looked like
a great beehive. There was only one room,
but what of that? If people are perfectly
comfortable they can be as happy in a one-roomed
hut as though they lived in a palace.</p>

<p>Alila has so many good times you would
almost envy him. In the first place, it takes
him only a minute to dress in the morning.
A pair of thin trousers and a shirt hanging
down outside instead of being tucked in at the
waist, and his toilet is made.</p>

<p>When he goes out into the sunlight, he
wears an odd-looking hat of rattan. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
made in the shape of a cone, and shields his
eyes nicely from the sunshine. He goes to
no school, so he does not know how to write
to his new American brothers, but that doesn't
trouble him in the least.</p>

<p>He always has enough to eat, and is satisfied
with a dinner of rice and fish any day. Besides,
there is always a bunch of bananas hanging
inside the house, and he has sugar-cane in
abundance.</p>

<p>He is hardly ever punished and is allowed
to do very much as he pleases. It is fortunate
that he pleases to do right nearly all the time.</p>

<p>He swims every day in the river; he fishes
from his bamboo raft; he hunts in the forest
with his father. His chief duty on the sugar
plantation is to keep the monkeys out of the
cane. It was not long ago that he shot two
of the mischievous little fellows with his bow
and arrow and hung the poor things on poles
like scarecrows to frighten others away.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<small>FOUR-FOOTED FRIENDS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Alila</span> has a tame monkey at home now.
He has taught him many clever tricks. Every
night when he goes to bed, the monkey curls
himself up by his side and lies there till morning.
He seems to love his little master very
dearly and often rides on his shoulder while
Alila is working.</p>

<p>Until a few months ago, the boy has lived
on a sugar plantation owned by a rich Tagal
planter. The plantation is divided up into
small farms and rented to different workmen.
The planter furnishes one buffalo and all the
needed tools to care for each little place.</p>

<p>When the harvest time arrives in December,
each tenant carries his crop to the mill for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
grinding. He is allowed one-third of it for
himself, and, whatever price it brings, it must
support his family for the next year.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 342px;">
<img src="images/i039.jpg" width="342" height="500" alt="boy riding pull" />
<div class="caption">"SOMETIMES ALILA RIDES ON HIS BACK"</div>
</div>

<p>Alila is not the least afraid of his father's
buffalo. When he was only three years old
the huge creature would obey him and allow
him to drive anywhere he pleased. He
seemed to know by the tone of the boy's
voice just what he wished him to do.</p>

<p>It made an odd picture,&mdash;the tiny little fellow,
holding a slender rein in his chubby
hands as he trotted along by the buffalo's
side. The rein was fastened to a piece of
split rattan drawn through the animal's nose.
Yet somehow every motion of Alila was
understood by him. Is it the boy's patience
that makes the beast so gentle? We like to
think so.</p>

<p>If we should take Alila's place the animal
would not stir to obey us. He would at
once become stubborn and ugly, because he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
is not used to our quick, nervous, impatient
ways.</p>

<p>He cannot work all day like a horse. After
two or three hours, he needs to stop and rest.
But that is not enough,&mdash;he suffers if he cannot
have a bath. Sometimes Alila rides on
his back when he plunges into the river, and
holds on without fear while the buffalo stretches
his head down and holds it under the water for
two minutes at a time as he searches for food.</p>

<p>How Alila does love him! He has the
next place in his heart to his father and
mother. But the buffalo has other good
friends beside Alila's family. They are not
people, nor even other buffaloes. They are
white herons that follow him as he ploughs.
They are not afraid if Alila is the only person
there. As the animal's heavy feet plod over
the ground, worms and insects come to the
surface. The herons know this and easily get
a good breakfast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides these attendants, a small blackbird
often keeps the buffalo company, who will
raise up his head in delight to meet it. Why
is it? Because the bird flies about his head
and neck and picks off the insects from his
skin.</p>

<p>This buffalo has lived on the farm from the
time he was caught wild when a baby. If he
had not been so young he could never have
been tamed. A wild buffalo is a terrible
thing; he is most to be dreaded of any creature
in the islands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<small>THE BUFFALO HUNT.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Alila's</span> father has been on several buffalo
hunts, but never yet has he allowed his boy to
go with him. He says it is far too dangerous;
the little boy must wait until he is older. But
it is so hard to wait, Alila thinks, as he longs
for the time to come and looks up at the
pair of horns brought home from the last
hunt.</p>

<p>The horns are very long and curved and
sharp. The boy often wonders if there is
another animal in the world with such fearful
horns. He says to himself:</p>

<p>"Perhaps the very buffalo who owned this
pair was the one that gored to death poor
Olo." Alila stretched himself on the ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
closed his eyes, and again pictured the story
in his mind. This is the tale:</p>

<p>In the village just below the plantation
there lived a young man who was honest and
brave but very poor. It happened that he
loved the daughter of a neighbour very dearly
and she returned his love. But the youth
had no money and no land, and at first the
girl's father said:</p>

<p>"No, you cannot have my daughter, for
you can give her no wedding portion."</p>

<p>It is the custom among these people for the
lover to give his bride as fine a present as her
parents think suitable. The young man felt
very sad, when an idea entered his mind that
gave him hope. He said to the father:</p>

<p>"Can I not come to your farm and serve
you for two years? And if I then show myself
faithful in all my duties, will you give me
your daughter?"</p>

<p>The father consented. It was a very common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
thing for such service to be given, and he
felt satisfied.</p>

<p>The two years passed by. The young man
had worked day after day at the hardest labour.
He had never spoken a cross word nor found
the slightest fault. But now that his service
was over and the day set for his marriage, he
wished to show the father of the lovely girl
how brave he was, and he wanted to make his
bride some little present, too.</p>

<p>He heard that a party of men, one of whom
was Alila's father, were going on a buffalo
hunt. He would join them. It was to be his
first venture of this kind, but he had no fear.</p>

<p>The party was made up of six men on horseback,
two tame buffaloes, and a pack of immense
dogs used to hunting. The men were
armed with knives and spears and each one
carried a lasso.</p>

<p>They started in the early morning and rode
out over the plains till they came to the edge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of a large forest. There they waited at some
little distance from an opening through the
trees while the dogs were sent into the forest
to rouse the prey. They had only a short
time to wait before the barking of the dogs
was heard.</p>

<p>They took their places some distance from
each other and listened breathless. The young
lover was to be given the first chance in this
combat. A bull-fight is fearful enough, but
it cannot compare with the struggle between a
maddened buffalo and his pursuer.</p>

<p>Hark! There is a crashing of trees, a falling
of branches. The ground shakes and out
from the darkness of the forest plunges a
huge buffalo. He raises a storm of dust
as he comes onward. He is shining black,
and as he tosses his head one can see the
wicked horns, capable of doing such terrible
injury.</p>

<p>For an instant he pauses and looks at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
men standing ready to capture him; then he
rushes toward the young man, who now has
the chance he begged for. With lasso in hand
he urges his horse toward the buffalo.</p>

<p>It is over in a moment's time. He has
hurled his lasso but has failed; and before he
can move out of danger the furious animal has
thrown him from his horse and ended his life.</p>

<p>But the other hunters cannot stop a second.
They, too, will lose their lives if they are not
careful and quick. One after another gallops
after the enraged animal and throws his lasso.
There are several failures, but each time the
men manage to escape. At last two are successful,
and the monster, hardly able to breathe,
stands quiet and still.</p>

<p>He is conquered. And now other lassos
are drawn tightly around that magnificent head
and the animal is tied to the stout trunk of a
tree. The danger is over for these others, but
the poor youth who longed so greatly to succeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
lies dead not far away. He will never see
his dear one again.</p>

<p>The men lift his body tenderly and carry it
to the place where the tame buffaloes have
been left. They place it on the back of one
of them. Then they return to their prey and
fasten a rattan ring through his nose. With
one of the tame buffaloes on each side of him,
he can now be easily led to the village, where
they will kill him.</p>

<p>All the people came out to meet the hunters,
and, when they heard the sad news, all hearts
were filled with pity for the young bride.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<small>THE RICH MAN'S HOME.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day as the boy lay dreaming of the
time when he should be allowed to risk his life
in a buffalo hunt, his quick ear heard the steps
of some one coming down the road. He
jumped up and saw an old friend of his
father's, a well-known hunter. He carried a
basket in each hand and would not have
stopped if Alila had not called out:</p>

<p>"Where have you been the last few days?
And where are you going? Father will be
home soon and he will wish to see you."</p>

<p>"I am on my way to the master's house to
sell these bird's nests and I will stop here on
my way back. I expect a good price for them.
He told me he would pay me well. Ah, but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
was hard work getting them, my little fellow!
You never could have done it in the world."</p>

<p>Alila looked at the hunter with envy, for he
knew how dangerous his work had been.
Among many people in the East, no food is
thought so great a dainty as these edible birds'
nests. What queer tastes they have! At
least it seems so to us.</p>

<p>There is a certain kind of bird that makes
its nest high up on the sides of steep cliffs jutting
out over the waters of the ocean. These
nests are like no others. The birds that build
them swallow a certain kind of glutinous weed
growing on the coral rocks. They then cough
it up and use this material they have so oddly
prepared in making their nests.</p>

<p>Whenever a man makes it his business to
search for these nests, he knows the danger full
well. Slowly and painfully he must climb the
sides of the cliffs, often placing his feet where
we should think there was no foothold whatever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
He clutches at a sharp point of rock
here, or a twig there; but if it is not as safe as
he believed, woe unto him! For down he falls
into the raging waters below and is a lucky
man if he is not dashed to pieces on the sharp
rocks. Again, he may grow faint and dizzy
when he has climbed only a part of the way,
or he may lose his hold from very weakness.</p>

<p>The Chinese are as fond of these edible
birds' nests as are the Filipinos. Perhaps you
have heard of the great Chinese viceroy, Li
Hung Chang, who came to visit us several
years ago. He brought his own cooks and a
large supply of birds' nests and sharks' fins.</p>

<p>Alila joined the hunter on his way to the
planter's mansion. The boy wished to have a
chance to see the grand lady, the planter's
wife, and their little daughter, who plays so
beautifully on the harp.</p>

<p>They soon reached the house, which seemed
very large beside Alila's little cabin. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
two stories high. The lower part was of stone
and the upper half of wood. It would not
have been safe to use stone above the lower
floor on account of the frequent earthquakes.</p>

<p>The roof was thatched with cogon grass.
When it was built the planter said to himself:
"I will not have an iron roof like many of the
city houses; it would be too hot. I like the
grass thatching much better."</p>

<p>Beautiful gardens where roses were always
in bloom surrounded the house. Bright-coloured
birds flew about among the bushes, but
they had no songs for Alila and the hunter as
they passed along. The broad veranda was
shaded by a clump of tall banana-trees, swaying
to and fro in the gentle breeze. How
noble they looked, with their tufts of glossy
leaves at the very top, lapping over each other
and shutting out the sun's hot rays!</p>

<p>As Alila glanced up to see if the fruit was
ripening the hunter said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you ever hear the stories told of the
banana? Some say it is the very fruit that
tempted Eve in the Garden of Eden, while
others think that she and Adam made their
first clothing of banana leaves."</p>

<p>"I wonder if that can be so," said the little
boy, thoughtfully. "Any way, I'm glad there
is fresh fruit every month in the year; I like
bananas so much."</p>

<p>They reached the house as he finished speaking.
The planter and his wife were sitting
alone on the veranda. Alila was disappointed
in not seeing their little daughter.</p>

<p>While the hunter was attending to his business
with the planter, the boy's bright eyes
noted the lady's dress.</p>

<p>"I must tell mother all about it," he said
to himself. "She will want to know. My,
what a long train she wears! It is so thin and
delicate I think it must be woven of pineapple
fibre. What beautiful bright colours it has!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"And how stiff her kerchief is! It stands
up so high at the back of her neck I should
think it would feel very uncomfortable. Her
chemisette is very pretty, my mother would
think. What wide sleeves! Still they are
short, so she can keep cool."</p>

<p>But the jewels! Alila had never seen so
many before. The lady fairly sparkled, with
her gold earrings and bracelets, set with precious
stones. Surely there was going to be a
party at the big house, or she would not be
dressed so finely.</p>

<p>Just as the boy was thinking this, the planter's
wife turned her head toward him and
spoke.</p>

<p>"Alila, is it not time to tap the cocoanut-trees?
Tell your father I want some tuba as
soon as possible. You are now such a big boy,
I suppose you will be able to help him get it."</p>

<p>The little fellow made a low bow and answered
that his father had spoken about it that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
very morning and had promised that he should
help him. Perhaps you remember that when
Alila was christened there was a good supply
of tuba at the feast. Did you wonder what
it could be?</p>

<p>On the sugar farm there is a clump of cocoanut-trees
on which no fruit ever grows. Why
is this? Because all the sap which would be
used by Mother Nature in making blossoms
and changing these into cocoanuts is used for
another purpose. It is drawn from the tree
at a certain time of the year to make a drink
much loved by the natives.</p>

<p>Tapping the trees for tuba is dangerous
work, but Alila, you know, loves danger. He
went home from the planter's mansion very
happy, for now he should have an errand
there every day during the next few weeks.
For must he not bring the family a fresh
bamboo of tuba each night and morning?</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<small>TAPPING FOR TUBA.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Alila</span> was wide awake before sunrise of the
next day. He did not lie on his mat lazily
watching to see if a lizard or newt should creep
out of a corner, as he often did on other mornings.
It was only the day before that he pulled
a newt by its tail just to see if the tail would
really come off in his hand. It did, for a fact!
and away Mr. Newt scuttled without any tail.</p>

<p>Wasn't it a little cruel and ungrateful in
Alila, when he knew how much the newts as
well as the lizards do to let him sleep comfortably?
They destroy ants and spiders and
other creeping things, so that Alila's mother
never kills them nor drives them away.</p>

<p>Neither did Alila stop to play with his pet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
cat this morning&mdash;such an odd cat, too, with
a queer little twist in her tail like that of a
pug dog. Alila was dressed before his father
waked.</p>

<p>While waiting, he went out into the yard
to sharpen his knife. But he had no whetstone.
There are more ways than one of
doing things, we have already discovered.
The boy took a piece of wood and covered
it with a paste made of ashes and oil. Then
he rubbed the blade of his knife back and
forth over this till the edge was sharp enough
to split a hair with ease.</p>

<p>Next he got together some vessels of bamboo
and two long bamboo rods. He was just
a little bit nervous, although it was not in his
nature to be easily excited. He said to
himself:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, I hope I shall not have to wait
much longer."</p>

<p>At this very moment he looked up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
there was his kind, quiet father standing in
the doorway.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 345px;">
<img src="images/i059.jpg" width="345" height="500" alt="Boy climbing palm tree" />
<div class="caption">"HE WAS AS NIMBLE AS A SQUIRREL"</div>
</div>

<p>"All ready!" And the two started for
the cocoanut grove not far away.</p>

<p>As soon as they reached the place, Alila
took out his sharp knife. Work began at
once, for notches must be cut in the tree, one
above another, in which to place his toes. As
one notch was made, the boy drew himself
high enough to get a foothold in it; then,
reaching up, he cut the next one and drew
himself up to that, and so on until he had
reached the top, fully sixty feet above the
ground. A cocoanut-tree, as you probably
remember, has no branches whatever to give
any help to a person in climbing.</p>

<p>And now Alila came down again. He did
it so easily and gracefully, it was a pleasure
to watch him. As soon as he was within
reach, his father handed him vessels of bamboo,
which the boy fastened to his waist and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
again climbed the tree. One might almost
say he was as nimble as a squirrel, yet that
does not express the long, graceful movements
of his body as he rose far from the ground.</p>

<p>When he was once more at the top of the
tree, he made deep cuts in the trunk directly
under the great tuft of leaves, and hung his
bamboo vessels so the sap could flow into
them.</p>

<p>Now for the same work in the next tree.
Do you think he must go down to the ground
again and go through all the work he had in
climbing the first tree? Not at all. His
father reached up to him two long bamboo
rods. He took the first one and stretched it
across to the next tree. This would serve as
a bridge over which he could walk. The
second one was placed above the first and
would make a good hand-rail.</p>

<p>Alila did not think of the danger of a walk
in mid-air on such a slender support. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
head was cool, his feet were firm, his body
light, and he passed from one tree to another
in perfect safety. He was happy as a king to
be trusted by his father to take such a risk.</p>

<p>Think of a fall from a height like that!
Suppose for one instant that the bamboo
should give way under the boy's feet or failed
to hold in the tree-top! That would have
ended our little Alila's life in a moment, or at
least made him a cripple for the rest of his
days.</p>

<p>The fact is, however, that the boy had no
accident, and every day afterward, as long as
the sap continued to flow, he went out to the
cocoanut grove, collected the tuba, and carried
a good supply of it to the planter's mansion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<small>FOREST AND STREAM.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is another cocoanut grove on the
farm, beside the one where Alila gets the tuba.
The fruit is allowed to ripen on these trees,
and it is the boy's duty to gather it. There is
a new growth of cocoanuts three times a year.</p>

<p>Alila does not need to climb the trees for
them unless he wishes. He usually fastens a
sickle-shaped knife to the end of a long pole.
In this way he can reach up to the tops of
the tallest trees and cut off the cocoanuts;
when thud! thud! down they fall to the
ground, safe and sound. For the delicious
pulp is not only shut up in the hard shell that
we know, but this also is enclosed in a still
larger and thicker covering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>How could the natives of tropic lands get
along without this valuable tree? It has so
many uses it would take a long time even to
mention them all.</p>

<p>Its roots are good to cure Alila when he is
seized by an attack of fever during the wet
season. His mother believes that his life has
been spared through the use of this medicine.
Alila's father made his canoe from the trunk
of a cocoanut-tree; while much of the furniture
in his employer's mansion has been carved
from its beautiful wood. The boy's mother
uses a comb made from the stalks of cocoanut
leaves. The husks which enclose the
fruit are made into <i>coir</i>, out of which are
made ropes, brooms, brushes, and even bedding.</p>

<p>When Alila was only five or six years old
he learned to weave baskets and mats from the
leaves, and he knows how to thatch a roof
with them very neatly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>What is so delicious on a hot day as a drink
of fresh cocoanut milk! It is never hurtful
and quenches the thirst as well as the coldest
water. The oil obtained from the nuts is used
by Alila's mother in her cooking.</p>

<p>But she also needs it for another purpose.
She is always in fear of an earthquake, and feels
safer to have a light burning in readiness all
night long. She keeps in the cabin a small
vessel half-full of water. Cocoanut oil is
poured on the water and a wick made of a certain
kind of pith called <i>tinsin</i> hangs down in
the middle of this odd lamp. The Chinese
taught the Tagals the value of tinsin. There
is scarcely to be found a native hut where it is
not used for lamp wicks.</p>

<p>But you must be tired of hearing about
cocoanuts and their uses, so we will return to
Alila and his strange adventures. One day
not long ago his mother said to him:</p>

<p>"My child, I should like some fish for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
dinner. Will you go to the river and get
some?"</p>

<p>Alila has great success in fishing. He started
off at once on his errand. He did not stop to
get hook and line, as you would have done;
he knew another way to fish, different from
any we have in our country.</p>

<p>When he got to the river he walked along
by its side till he found a place where the
water ran very deep. Then he took off his
clothing, and lay quietly down on the bank.
His eyes were wide open and watchful, though
his body was so still. He soon saw some fish
rise near the surface of the water. Quick as
a flash he jumped in and dived down, down
under where the fish were darting. Rising
as suddenly as he had dived, he came to the
surface with a fish in each hand.</p>

<p>He is such a nimble little fellow that he did
this several times, and hardly ever failed. It
was not long before he had a fine string of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
fish to carry home. As he walked back,
he stopped to gather some green bamboos
of medium size, for he knew they would be
needed in cooking the dinner.</p>

<p>While his mother was cleaning the fish,
Alila made a fire and cut the bamboos at
every joint. They were changed at once into
baking pans, each one large enough to slip
a fish inside, together with a little water and
some spices. The ends were stopped up, and
the bamboos laid in the fire. As soon as they
began to burn, it was a sign that the fish inside
were cooked enough.</p>

<p>What a good dinner it was! You would
have thought so if you could have tasted the
rice steamed in the same way as the delicate
fish and served on plantain leaves.</p>

<p>Alila has still another way of fishing which
is not as hard work as diving, though, after
all, it is not much fun. He carries a bamboo
basket in which he has put a mixture containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
a curious kind of poison. He sets it floating
on the water. When the fish come near
it the poison makes them stupid, and they rise
and float motionless on the surface, as though
they were dead. Then it is an easy matter for
Alila to get them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<small>A SWARM OF LOCUSTS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> little brown boy has lived, as you
know, on a sugar plantation, where the cane
ripens only once a year. You also remember
that last summer a hurricane destroyed the
boy's home, and a new one had to be built.
The sugar crop barely escaped ruin, when,
alas! another danger came to it, more fearful
even than the great wind. It was a storm of
locusts.</p>

<p>Alila was working in the cane-fields with his
loved buffalo one morning, when, looking up
suddenly, he saw something which frightened
him. It was a long distance away, far as his
eyes could see, and it appeared like a dark
cloud near the earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 345px;">
<img src="images/i071.jpg" width="345" height="500" alt="people trying to wave off swam of locusts" />
<div class="caption">"SUCH A DIN AND COMMOTION YOU NEVER HEARD"</div>
</div>

<p>The boy was frightened, as I have said, but
it was not for himself. It was on account of
the danger threatening the plantation; he
knew very well that what seemed like a cloud
was composed of millions and millions of
locusts. Unless something were done at once,
all the sugar-cane would be ruined. For, if
that army of insects, perfectly harmless to
animals, should settle down upon the canes,
the leaves would be entirely eaten in a few
hours.</p>

<p>Alila ran as fast as his legs could carry him
from one part of the plantation to another,
and gave the alarm to the working people
as he passed along.</p>

<p>It was wonderful how quickly men, women,
and children armed themselves to meet the
coming enemy. All the bamboo clappers,
cocoanut shells, tin pans, and red flags that
could be found were seized and put into use.</p>

<p>Then such a din and commotion you never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
heard nor saw, even on the glorious Fourth
of July. Locusts are very sensitive to noise,
so between the beating of drums and clappers,
the waving of the red flags, and the smoke
from fires of wet wood at the sides of the
fields, the greater part of the army passed on.
The people breathed again, since the danger
was over for the present.</p>

<p>When it was all over Alila was not too tired
to play for awhile with a few locusts he had
caught in a net. Their bodies looked like
those of large grasshoppers, except that they
were of a brownish colour.</p>

<p>They would not sting or bite, and the boy
kept his new pets as long as they lived. That
was only a few days, however, as a locust has
a very short life. It is said that food passes
through its body as fast as it is eaten, so it is
not nourished, and soon dies for this reason.
It also has an enemy, a small worm that forms
in its body and gradually eats it up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>The mother locust has a queer way of making
a nest for her eggs. She extends the end
of her body till it is like an auger, and with
this she bores a deep hole in the earth. She
chooses spots near fields of ripening rice or
sugar cane, so the young locusts, as they hatch
out, will be near a good supply of food; for at
first they have no wings and cannot go in
search of it.</p>

<p>After the visit of the locusts, Alila went
carefully around the edges of the fields with
the other workmen. They wished to see if
any signs of young locusts could be found.
But they found none and felt that the crops
were free from danger for this year, at least.
But Alila's father said to himself:</p>

<p>"How many risks there are in working on
a sugar plantation! I have been here now
many years. I never know whether the crop
will be a failure or not. I believe I will go
somewhere else. Up on the side of the mountain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
not far from here, is a large hemp plantation;
I will seek work there. Besides, there
is fine hunting near by and Alila can see new
sights."</p>

<p>When he told his family, they were all
pleased, for Tagals dearly love a change and
often move from place to place merely for the
sake of change. Alila was the most delighted
of all. He said:</p>

<p>"Now, father, I can hunt with you and go
bat shooting in the deep forests. You know
I can sell their beautiful soft skins to travellers."</p>

<p>Alila's grandmother and mother were
pleased, too. They liked the idea because
the hemp is gathered throughout the year and
can be sold from time to time, whenever there
is need of money. But when the women
thought of the bands of brigands who hide in
the mountain passes, they began to fear.</p>

<p>Many were the stories they had heard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
these robbers and their sudden attacks in the
night-time on people in lonely houses.</p>

<p>"You need not worry," said Alila's father,
"for these wild robbers seldom harm poor
people; and they never kill unless they are
obliged to do so. I believe they are not as
terrible as they are often described."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<small>THE NEW HOME.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">So</span> it came to pass that Alila went to a new
home. It was not hard work to get ready, for
there was little to move. The old buffalo that
had grown up with his young master was able
to carry on his broad back everything owned
by the entire family. He could easily have
taken more, too!</p>

<p>The women rode on ponies and the men
walked beside the buffalo. No one seemed to
feel sad, although it had been an easy, happy
life on the little farm and the sugar planter had
always been kind.</p>

<p>Their fellow workmen were Tagals like
themselves; they would find many Chinese
labourers on the hemp plantation, at least they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
had been told so. But they did not care for
that.</p>

<p>There are many Chinamen in the Philippines,
and they agree very well with their Tagal
neighbours and the people of the many other
tribes. Alila has a cousin married to a
Chinese merchant in Manila and some time
he is going to visit her.</p>

<p>As they journeyed onward they passed a
party of Americans. Alila's mother called:</p>

<p>"Come nearer to me, my child. Stay by
my side."</p>

<p>She had a fear of white faces of which she
could not rid herself. The Spaniards had been
cruel to her people, she well knew. And now
that these others from far-away lands had taken
the power from the Spaniards, she felt that
they, too, would be hard and unkind.</p>

<p>Poor ignorant mother! She did not understand
that it meant such different things,&mdash;schools
for <em>all</em> children instead of a very few;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
work for any one who desired it; better care
for the sick in the cities; fewer taxes for all.
Yes, all these and many other good things
would be done by the Americans to make
Alila and Alila's children live more wisely and
therefore more happily.</p>

<p>When the sun was setting that night, the
hemp plantation could be plainly seen. It
was a beautiful sight, those rows of small trees
with their large, glossy leaves, shut in by
woods of a larger growth.</p>

<p>The plant from which is made what is called
Manila hemp belongs to the same family as
the banana and the plantain. The leaves all
of them look so much alike it would be hard
for us to tell the difference.</p>

<p>It did not take many days to get settled.
The neighbours were very kind and gave the
family shelter and food until Alila and his
father had finished building a cabin. This
time they made the roof as well as the sides of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the hut of split bamboo, and the boy's mother
and grandmother helped in preparing it.</p>

<p>Alila had never before seen hemp gathered,
and he had much to learn. He was soon very
quick in separating the fibres from the pulp
and spreading them out to dry before packing.</p>

<p>The boy sometimes wonders what journeys
the bales of hemp will take. To what countries
will they sail? To what uses will they be
put? His father has told him that nothing
else in his island home is shipped in such
quantities as Manila hemp. It makes stout
cordage and sail-cloth; it is woven into mats,
carpets, and hammocks; while the finest hemp
is made into delicate dress goods for the rich
ladies of the island.</p>

<p>Yes, people all over the world have heard
of Manila hemp, and when he is older, Alila
says he will bear it company and seek strange
sights across the oceans.</p>

<p>He had lived in his new home but a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
time when he had an exciting adventure. Not
far from the farm there is a dense forest. One
night Alila's father said to his friends:</p>

<p>"Let us go on a hunt for wild boars.
There must be plenty of boars and deer, too,
in those woods."</p>

<p>The other men were ready for a little sport.
They had been hunting in the forest many
times before, and knew the best course to take.</p>

<p>"May I go with you, too?" whispered
Alila, who was listening at his father's side.</p>

<p>When all agreed that it would make no
trouble to allow the boy to go with them, since
he was brave and strong, he was greatly pleased.
They would be gone several days. What new,
strange creatures should he see? What dangers
should he meet?</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<small>IN THE FOREST.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> party started out early the next morning.
They carried very little food with them;
it would only be in their way when hunting,
and they trusted Mother Nature would supply
what they needed as they went along. Two
of the men had guns; the others carried bows
and arrows. Every one was also supplied with
a sharp spear and knife.</p>

<p>The first day was very quiet. Nothing was
shot but a few birds and bats. When night
came they found themselves far from any
stream; all were thirsty and there was no
water. What should they do? Ah! in plain
sight was a <i>liana</i>. It is called the "travellers'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
drink" because any one, on breaking off a
stalk, can obtain a cool draught. How refreshing
it was!</p>

<p>A fire was quickly made and the birds
cooked for supper. They all lay down to
sleep. But, alas! that was not an easy thing
to get. They had no sooner stretched themselves
by the fire than they were attacked. By
wild animals, you think at once. By no means.
It was a small enemy, fierce for their blood,
which darted out from the grass and fastened
upon their bodies.</p>

<p>Multitudes of leeches have their home in
the mountain forests of the Philippines, and
every native who travels there is armed with a
small rattan knife to cut them off as they seize
upon him.</p>

<p>Alila's party knew that sleep was out of the
question for this night. As fast as our little
brown brother was able to cut off one of the
bloodthirsty creatures, another took its place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
till at last the daylight came and the hunters
could go on their way.</p>

<p>But what a wretched sight they were!
Blood streamed from their arms and legs,
and they looked like the wounded survivors
of a terrible battle. When they came to a
spring of water, they were glad enough to
have a chance to bathe.</p>

<p>Alila can tell you that was the worst night
he ever passed in his life, yet he hardly spoke
a word of complaint through the long hours,
and in the morning laughed gaily with his
friends when they gazed at each other's sorry-looking
faces.</p>

<p>Small creatures can make themselves as
troublesome as big ones. Perhaps you have
already found this out when mosquitoes have
found their way to your bedside and waked
you in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>After a hasty breakfast, the hunters were
ready for a tramp, and they soon found the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
tracks of wild boars. It was not long till they
had killed three of them with little trouble.
They were about to make a fire and roast
some of the flesh for dinner, when a pitiful
cry was heard.</p>

<p>How it rang out through the forest! It
sounded almost human. What could it be?
Alila's father jumped up and crept through
the woods in the direction of the sound. His
boy followed close at his heels. They had
gone but a short distance when a strange sight
met their eyes. High up on the branch of a
tree lay a huge boa-constrictor. He must have
been a hundred years old, he was so large.</p>

<p>His eyes were fastened upon a poor little
deer in the coil of his tail, which he had
stretched down to trap his prey as it walked
along. Ah! the deer's eyes close and the
piteous cry stops as he is clasped more and
more tightly in the clutch of the boa. And
now the serpent raises him from the ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and swings him against the trunk of the tree;
he is thrown with such force he is instantly
killed.</p>

<p>But what were Alila and his father doing all
this time? They were too late to save the
deer, but the boa did not escape. As he was
about to descend the tree to feed upon his
victim, his wicked eyes saw the hunters for
the first time. Out darted his forked tongue
in anger, just as two arrows entered his body
and ended his life. The rest of the party
came up at this moment and helped cut away
the skin of the boa. It would be useful for
making dagger sheaths.</p>

<p>Now indeed they would have a grand feast,
for they could add the flesh of the deer and
boa to what they had already obtained.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<small>CROCODILES.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> dinner was over, they began to look
around their stopping-place. They found they
were close to a deep river. Should they swim
across it, or turn homeward?</p>

<p>"You must not try to cross without a boat,"
said one of the men to Alila's father. "Crocodiles
make their home in these waters. It is
possible we may not see any from this shore,
but at the same time, if you should try to
swim to the other side, you might be attacked
suddenly, and be unable to escape. I know
one poor fellow who lost his life in this very
place.</p>

<p>"Still, if you wish for more sport, I will tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
you what to do. Let us all watch on the
shore here for signs of crocodiles. We are in
no hurry. Have your guns and arrows ready
to help if one of the creatures should appear.
I will dive into the river and attack him with
my spear."</p>

<p>It was a daring thing to think of. As every
one knew, there is only one place in the animal's
body that can be pierced. That is
directly under the fore legs. Even bullets
will fly off from any other part of the scaly
covering as though they had struck against a
stone wall.</p>

<p>If the hunter venture to come close to
such a monster, and his dagger fail to pierce
the vital spot, there is no help for him. The
great jaws will close upon him instantly, and
he will never be seen again.</p>

<p>But the quiet Tagals seem to love danger,
and no one tried to discourage the hunter.
They walked quietly along the river's side for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
two hours, at least; they were about to turn
when Alila cried:</p>

<p>"There he is, close to the bamboo thicket
on the shore."</p>

<p>As they looked toward the spot, the fearful
head and jaws of a crocodile could be seen
reaching up out of the water.</p>

<p>Ready! Down dived the hunter, spear in
hand. The attack was sudden and successful.
The spear reached the one place it could enter,
and stuck fast. The diver did not stop a moment
longer, but swam back to the shore to
his waiting friends. The surface of the river
was instantly streaked with blood as the crocodile
plunged through the water in his death
agony.</p>

<p>The men waited till the great body of the
monster became still and quiet. Then with
the aid of rattan nooses they drew it up on the
shore, and with their sharp knives proceeded
to strip away the skin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is a good medicine for rheumatism. I
know it will cure the bad pains from which my
mother suffers," said Alila's father.</p>

<p>"And I will take some of the flesh and dry
it as a cure for asthma," said another of the
party. "I know a man who suffers very
much from the trouble. He will be glad to
be able to breathe easily once more."</p>

<p>It was now near night and too late to think
of starting home. They must camp out once
more. Every one hoped to be free from the
persistent leeches this time. They made a fire
and stretched themselves beside it.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<small>TONDA'S STORY.</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Tonda</span>, do tell us some of your adventures,"
begged Alila. "You have travelled so
far and seen such wonderful things! Father
says you have even been to the great city of
Manila. I wonder what a city can be like."</p>

<p>Tonda had certainly seen more of the world
than any one Alila knew, and he was always
proud and glad to show his knowledge. So,
although he was tired and sleepy from the excitement
of the day, he began to tell of his
visit to Manila when a young man.</p>

<p>"Oh, a city is indeed a wonderful place,
Alila; I believe you would be almost frightened,
at first, at the queer noises you would
hear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 341px;">
<img src="images/i093.jpg" width="341" height="500" alt="crowd of people at city gate" />
<div class="caption">"'AROUND ONE PART OF THE CITY THERE IS A STRONG
WALL'"</div>
</div>

<p>"What would you think of long, heavy cars
rushing along through the streets with no buffaloes
to draw them and a single pony in their
place? These cars run along on tracks
through streets in which round stones are set
in, side by side.</p>

<p>"There are great buildings divided by walls
into many different rooms. Around one part
of the city there is a strong wall which was built
long, long ago, I was told. Behind those walls
the people used to fight against their enemies
and were safe.</p>

<p>"There is a river running right through the
city, and upon it many kinds of boats sail at
every hour of the day and night. While I
was there, the Chinese had a grand festival.
Great ships like floating palaces rode up and
down the river. At night they were lighted
up from topmast to stern. Bands of music
kept playing, and every morning the Chinese
who filled the vessels threw squares of coloured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
paper over the sides and burned incense
in honour of St. Nicholas, in whose memory
they held the festival.</p>

<p>"Why was St. Nicholas honoured so?
Because in far distant times he saved the life
of a Chinaman from the fury of a crocodile.</p>

<p>"It happened in this way. The man was
sailing on the river in a small canoe, with no
thought of danger. All at once, a crocodile
appeared close to the boat, capsized it, and
with open jaws was ready to devour the man.
It was a fearful moment, but the Chinaman
did not lose hope. He lifted up his voice in
prayer to St. Nicholas, and begged him to
save his life. The good saint appeared before
him, and, striking the crocodile with his wand,
changed it instantly into a rock.</p>

<p>"The man was saved, but you may be sure
he did not forget the wonderful help he had
received. He went back to Manila, and with
the help of his friends built a chapel in honour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of the saint. Every year since then the Chinese
have gathered in the city and remembered
the day when their countryman's life was
saved. They hold one festival after another
during two whole weeks. The people say
that the city is always a gay sight at such
times."</p>

<p>By the time this story was finished, the
company gathered around the fire began to
nod their heads. They were so tired from
the day's hard work that they could listen no
longer. A minute afterward Alila was sound
asleep. He knew nothing more till the sunlight
fell upon him the next morning.</p>

<p>On the way home two more boars and
a deer were shot. A bamboo hurdle was
quickly made, and the store of flesh was
placed on it and easily carried on the shoulders
of the men.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<small>STRANGE NEIGHBOURS.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">You</span> can imagine how glad Alila's mother
was to see him back once more, safe and
sound. She kissed him tenderly in the odd
fashion of her people. When he had told her
all his adventures, he said:</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, I want to go again. I
haven't seen half of the strange things in
those forests. And, besides, hunters have
told me of queer people who live high up
in the mountains beyond us. They are very
wild, and have such strange customs. It is
said that they lived in these islands before
our people came here, hundreds and hundreds
of years ago. They must have been driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
up into the thick forests to save themselves
from being captured.</p>

<p>"The men call them Negritos. They are
very black, and do not look at all like us.
Their hair is a great ball of curls. They do
not know much more than animals."</p>

<p>"Yes, my child, I have not only heard
about these savages, I have seen one of
them," replied his mother. "Your father
has been among them, and will tell you about
their queer ways of living. They have no
homes, but sleep at night under the trees.
If you heard them talking, you would think
at first it was the chattering of monkeys.
They have very few words in their language.</p>

<p>"When they plant their gardens, they do
not plough them as we do. They only scrape
away the top of the earth, and then scatter
their seed. They do not even clear places
in the forests."</p>

<p>While she was telling Alila these things, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
father was not there. As soon as he got back
from the hunt, he went off to look over the
farm to see if the hemp was growing well.
When he returned from this work Alila went
up to him, and said:</p>

<p>"Why is it, father, you have never told me
about the Negritos? I never even heard of
them till I went on the hunt with you and
your friends."</p>

<p>"I knew how you like daring deeds, my
boy, and felt you would be anxious to go
among these savages and see them for yourself.
So I waited till you should be older.
Now you have shown how much you can
bear, I will take you into strange places, and
you shall see things for yourself. The Negritos
are a cowardly race, yet they are dangerous;
they always use poisoned arrows, and, from
their safe hiding-places in the mountains, often
succeed in killing any people who dare to come
near them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he told Alila how the Negrito children
are taught to use their bows and arrows when
very young. They learn to shoot so well
they can hit the fish swimming in the water.
They seldom fail to hit what they aim at.</p>

<p>These savages live mostly on roots and
fruits. Still, they do know how to make
a fire and cook some of their game. But they
have no dishes, and the bird or animal to be
eaten is thrown among the embers and allowed
to stay there till the outside is burned to a
crisp. When any one among them is very
ill, they do not wait for him to die, but bury
him alive.</p>

<p>One of the most laughable things Alila's
father ever saw was a Negrito wedding. The
young bride pretended to run away from her
future husband. After he had caught her,
they were carried up a bamboo ladder by their
friends, and sprinkled with water out of a
cocoanut shell. Then they came down and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
knelt on the ground, and an old man touched
their heads together. That made them man
and wife.</p>

<p>Alila was much interested, and begged his
father to tell more stories of the Negritos and
other savage tribes living in the depths of the
island forests.</p>

<p>He listened to tales of the Igorrotes, who
live in huts like beehives and creep into them
like insects. They are people whom the white
men have tried again and again to conquer and
to teach of God, but they prefer to go naked
and lead their own savage life.</p>

<p>And then his father described to him some
of the sights he had seen. He told him of a
wonderful cave right there in his own island
of Luzon. It was equal in beauty to the cave
Aladdin himself had entered.</p>

<p>Wonderful pendants of crystallised lime
reached down from the lofty roof, shining
like diamonds. There were pillars of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
snowy lime a hundred feet in height, glittering
in dazzling beauty. There were spacious
halls leading one from another in this underground
palace. It was a dangerous journey
into this wonderful cave, but sometime Alila
must go there, his father said.</p>

<p>He should visit the volcano island, too,&mdash;an
island in the middle of a lake, from
which terrible floods of lava and boiling water
have poured forth many times. What sorrow
and destruction it has caused!</p>

<p>A long, long time ago, the boy's father cannot
tell how many years have passed, there
was a terrible eruption. It lasted for many
days. There were quakings of the earth and
horrible sounds under ground. The air was
filled with darkness save for flashes of
lightning. Great columns of mud and sand
arose from out the lake. Torrents of lava
poured over the sides of the volcano and destroyed
whole villages on the shores of the lake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Ah! it was a fearful time for the people, and
few of those who were there lived to tell the
story to their children.</p>

<p>Alila's eyes grew larger as he listened to the
wonders of the world around him. Yes, he
would travel and see these things for himself.
He was growing impatient. He could not
wait much longer, for now he was nearly a
man grown.</p>

<p>Sometime, let us hope, we shall meet our
little Alila. We will ask him what he himself
has learned that no one else can tell us.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<small>THE STOUT-HEARTED SAILOR.</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> Alila is anxious to travel and
learn more of this great round world, yet his
own people seldom leave their island home.
Strange to say, however, white travellers from
distant lands began to visit these shores hundreds
of years ago.</p>

<p>The first one to do this was a brave admiral
named Ferdinand Magellan. What wonderful
adventures filled the life of this man! It
seems almost like a fairy tale.</p>

<p>After Columbus made his famous voyages
across the Atlantic and discovered America,
Magellan, who lived in Portugal, was much
excited over the news. The world must certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
be round, he thought, and he was no
longer satisfied to explore the waters near his
own home. He, too, wished to find new and
distant lands; but this was not enough. He
felt sure he could discover a way to the countries
of the East, rich in silks, spices, and
precious gems, by sailing west.</p>

<p>The King of Portugal was a powerful ruler
and anxious for new possessions, yet he did
not encourage Magellan. Instead of this, he
was ordered to go back to Africa and keep on
fighting against the Moors, for he had already
won many victories there. The king was
even stern to him for leaving the war in
Africa. Why had he returned to Portugal
to ask for other work than what had been
given him?</p>

<p>It was a sad disappointment, and Magellan
turned away from the king's presence with a
bitter heart. It was almost impossible for
him to keep from bursting into tears, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
he was a brave, strong man. Just as he was
leaving the palace, an old friend stopped him
and whispered:</p>

<p>"Why do you not go to the King of Spain
and ask his help? He is young, to be sure,
but he will be glad to get the services of a
brave man from any country, for he is anxious
to gain new lands and greater power."</p>

<p>Magellan's first thought was, "I cannot
leave the service of my own country for that
of another." But afterward he said to himself,
"No, I am not right in working for one
king when I can do more for the world in
serving another. I feel that I shall do much
yet. And I am willing to dare great risks,
and give my life even, for the sake of what
is not yet known."</p>

<p>He went to Spain and offered his services
to King Charles. You will be pleased to
know that this king was the grandson of the
very Isabella who so nobly helped Columbus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
The young king was filled with the spirit of
his grandmother. He said to Magellan:</p>

<p>"Your plan is good; you are daring, yet
cautious; you shall have ships and supplies.
So be of good courage and prepare for your
voyage."</p>

<p>Magellan's heart bounded with joy. He
promised the king that wherever he should
land in places not discovered before, there he
would plant the flag of Spain. He also vowed
that he would do his best to teach the Christian
religion to the heathen and that a goodly
company of priests should go with him to
baptise all who were willing.</p>

<p>At last the great day came when Magellan
set sail. Shortly before, he was married to
one whom he had long loved and whom, alas!
he should never see again after leaving the
shores of Spain. He and his fair young wife
had watched the building and repairing of the
ships which were to sail away with him so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
soon. With her at his side, he had studied
the rude maps of the Atlantic Ocean made by
earlier voyagers, and the instruments which
should aid him in managing the fleet.</p>

<p>The great moment arrived at last. Amidst
the shouts of the people, the peals of the bells,
and the roaring of the cannon, the anchors
were lifted and the fleet sailed into the West.</p>

<p>Days passed quietly by. The weather was
good, and Magellan, now Admiral Magellan,
watched constantly for land. Many wonderful
things were seen by the sailors as they
crossed the broad Atlantic. There were shoals
of flying-fish, strange and interesting birds,
besides immense sharks that followed the ships
for days at a time.</p>

<p>After a voyage of over two months, the
coast of South America came in sight. The
fleet stopped at different places; at one time
finding themselves among friendly savages, at
another among a race of unfriendly giants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Each time the ships were headed farther and
farther south.</p>

<p>At this time Magellan had other troubles
besides directing the fleet. You remember
that he was a Portuguese, although he was
sailing under the King of Spain. So it happened
that while some of the sailors were from
Magellan's country, most of them were Spaniards.
These latter were jealous of their
leader because he belonged to a different nation
from themselves. Some of them talked
secretly together and made a plan to imprison
him and take possession of the ships.</p>

<p>But Magellan learned of their wicked plot
in time to defeat them, and he punished them
as they deserved. Only a cool and daring man
could have succeeded in defeating so many
strong enemies. But he did succeed, and the
ships sailed onward as though nothing had
happened.</p>

<p>It grew colder and colder. A violent storm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
arose and the ships were tossed about like
leaves in the wind. But Magellan was without
fear and kept his men filled with courage. At
length he reached a narrow passage leading to
the west. He said to his captains:</p>

<p>"I believe we have come to the end of this
continent. If we can make our way through
this strait we shall look upon the new ocean."</p>

<p>And the brave explorer sailed safely through
the dangerous strait now named for him.
The storm passed away, and one bright, clear
morning Magellan looked for the first time
upon a new and vast extent of water. It was
the dreamed-of ocean. It looked so calm and
peaceful that he said, "I will call it 'Pacific,'
for I have never seen the like before."</p>

<p>Weeks were spent upon these waters. They
were so quiet that for days at a time the ships
could not advance. There was hardly a breath
of wind.</p>

<p>And now it was discovered that the supplies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
were getting low. The sailors thought of
home so far away, of friends they might never
see again; they pictured death by starvation
here in the midst of these beautiful waters.
The food was served out in smaller and
smaller portions to the unhappy men. At last
they were told there was nothing left to satisfy
their hunger save the rats which infested the
ships and some ox-hides which had been used
to protect the rigging.</p>

<p>Think for a moment of the condition of
Magellan and those with him. They were
out of sight of land in the midst of an unknown
ocean. Some were already dying of
thirst; others were too sick and weak to help
in the care of the ship. Do you wonder that
the sailors felt bitter at the one who had
brought them here and was the cause of
their suffering? But Magellan did not give
up courage, even now. He ordered the hides
to be softened in the sea water and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
boiled. For some days longer the crews
managed to live on with this for food.</p>

<p>One morning, when hope was nearly gone,
a fresh breeze from the east filled the sails of
the ships, and in a few hours Magellan saw
land in the distance. The men's hearts beat
hard for joy at the welcome sight. They
soon reached a small island where ripe fruits
were abundant, and where they could provide
fresh supplies for the ships.</p>

<p>But they did not stay many days, for Magellan
was not even now ready to give up his
search for the famous lands of the East. He
felt that, as the world was round, he must
surely be near them by this time. So once
more the ships set sail, and soon reached the
shores of one of the Philippines, but a short
distance from Alila's home. It looked so
rich and beautiful that the ships anchored
once more, and the admiral ordered the sick
men to be taken on shore. Large tents were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
set up, and the sufferers were nursed back to
health and strength. There was an abundance
of good pure water and fresh food. All were
soon well and strong.</p>

<p>There were no people living on this island,
but two days after he arrived Magellan saw
some canoes out upon the water. They were
coming swiftly toward the camp. They were
filled with natives of another island near by, who
had seen the ships of the strangers; they were
curious to look upon the white men who
were living near them.</p>

<p>These people of Alila's race had soft yellow
skins and beautiful white teeth. They wore
no clothing except aprons made of bark.
They danced around the great admiral as he
stood on the shore dressed in his most elegant
garments, and laughed and shouted.
They wished him to see they were friendly.
They offered fresh fish and palm wine, cocoanuts
and figs, while Magellan made them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
wildly happy by giving them looking-glasses
and bells, ivory toys and brass trinkets. As
he found them honest and peaceful, he allowed
them to go on board his ships. He ordered
his men to fire the cannon to amuse them,
but the noise frightened them so much that
some of them jumped into the water and
came near drowning.</p>

<p>The chief of these people came to see the
Spaniards. His face was painted, and he
wore heavy gold earrings and bracelets. He
was kind and pleasant. He brought a boat-load
of fruit and, best of all, some chickens.</p>

<p>Magellan learned from these people that he
was near still richer and larger islands. After
a few days he started out once more. He
passed island after island, sometimes landing
on their shores, sometimes sailing slowly along,
drawing a map of these new and wonderful
places.</p>

<p>At the island of Cebu, Magellan made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
friends with the king, who was baptised by the
priests, and pretended to become a Christian.
A large cross bearing a wooden crown was set
up on the top of a high hill near the shore.
It was a token to all travellers who should
come this way that this land now belonged to
the King of Spain.</p>

<p>While the white visitors were staying here,
the King of Cebu did all he could to entertain
them. He seemed anxious to show how
friendly he felt toward them. The Spanish
sailors were much interested in the strange
customs and festivals of the brown people.
They noticed that the food was only half
cooked and then heavily salted. This made
the eaters very thirsty, and quite ready to
drink quantities of palm wine afterward. They
sucked this through long reeds of bamboo.
They were always glad to have the sailors
share their feasts and entertainments.</p>

<p>Just as the fleet was about to set sail again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
something happened to change Magellan's
plans. The King of Cebu was in trouble.
The people of another island over whom he
was also the ruler were coming to make war
upon him. Could the brave admiral refuse
help, when the king had treated him so
kindly? Surely not. He said to the king:</p>

<p>"Let me go against these rebels and make
peace for you. I have cannons which I will
use, and other weapons of war such as they
have never seen before. They will be easily
terrified, and quickly submit to your rule."</p>

<p>So it was that Magellan and sixty of his followers
sailed against the enemy. But when
they arrived at the island they found a large
army ready to meet them. The warriors carried
sharp spears, bows, and poisoned arrows,
and each man was protected by a wooden
shield. They stood upon the side of a hill.
As Magellan and his men landed and advanced
toward them, they rushed down upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Spaniards with fury, surrounding them on all
sides.</p>

<p>The great leader was calm and brave as
usual, but there was little hope for success.
In another hour he had fallen, a noble victim
to his savage foes. Many of his followers fell
by his side; the rest managed to escape to the
ships and sail back to Cebu to tell the sad
news to the king.</p>

<p>Thus ended the life of the noble Magellan,
the first white man to cross the broad waters
of the Pacific, the first one to show others it
was indeed possible to sail around the world.</p>

<p>He was unlike many who lived in those old
days,&mdash;for he did not care for gold or great
possessions. He only wished to know more
of this wonderful world, and to help others to
greater wisdom. He gave his life for one
whom he thought had need of help.</p>

<p>How did the King of Cebu act when he
learned of the leader's death? He turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
against those of his followers who were left,
and they were obliged to depart in haste.</p>

<p>They made still other discoveries of great
value. At length, sailing around the continent
of Africa, they returned to Spain to tell of the
brave deeds of their dead leader, the great admiral
and navigator, and their own strange
adventures.</p>

<p>They were the first men to sail around the
world.</p>
